# The prompt direction that made the base app
i want a localhost based app using flask, html, css for running llms locally which have to provide a ui over ollama. i run locally using ollama. this should properly see all the models that ive downloaded and show that in the UI. Also, i should be able to save multiple default prompts, which i should be able to reuse using a click. make teh UI look great


features needed
- show gpu, cpu usage
- show ram, vram usage (it getting filled up as we load models)
- stream the results
- the UI should support codeblocks(with python color for LSP and all)
- UI should support rendering tables
- refresh talk and clear context button at top right
- store conversation history
- ability to edit/ delete saved prompts


- i want the gpucpu info in 2 boxes. 
    - first shows cpu % and RAM in numbers(7.6/16GB)
    - second shows gpu% and VRAM in numbers(1.2/4GB)
    - this should update very fast (every 0.25 seconds)

- the history is saving every talk and back in full conversation as separate history. one conversation needs to be in one history block only
- add copy button for codeblocks
- When you are loading any model, say loaing model. 
- tell the tokens per second for conversation as small text and total token per conv
- add model page which contains details for model such as model params, size, company, etc. 

- make sure the vram for gpu is working
- add a restart server option, which pkills ollama and starts the server

- add a little bit of spacebetween %usage and ram for both cpu and gpu - they are coinciding now
- add a favourite option, which lets me favourite models - these models appear first in model selector
- some models think. I want this thinking to appear in another box while thinking happens. This box is  always in condensed mode and will reveal only after the user pressing it

- the stop generating button doesnt stop genereating instantly, pls fix
- change clear context to new chat(it should also set teh token usage to 0)
now give me whole code, dont miss out anyything

one more modification, can u do it so that i can add whatever template i want for the model card and add additional information to it. these information should come up in the model card. make sure not to remove any other code or anything else. add a separate file to design the model card template. 
so the working of model card will be like when it sees a model listed in ollama, u look at model card to see if additional info is in it. if it is, the additional info is also shown
dont break or remove anything, pls

i want multiple classes within the model selector. it should be: chat, coding and fast.
Then, i want models to be placed in the correct position as my model_cards. also instead of CTX, change it to speed, which i can add as a param manually in my model_cards.

i want to have the ability to rename the model name to show in the model card. also, i want "vision" next to the size of the model in the model card for models that support vision. If the model support vision capabilities, i should be able to drag drop images into the the chat place and give it to the model. The image history can be stored with the history. now give me whole code, dont miss out anyything.dont break or remove anything, pls 

i want the following changes
- add it so that the model with vision can support having more than one images as attachment(or copy paste)
- add it so that clicking on the ollama studio creates a new chat
- just like the "vision" text in model card, i want "reasoning" for models that think, take time and respond
- when the model is thinking, the thinking tokens should be seen in the website as a separate box(with smaller italics font)

dont remove any feature, dont touch unwanted things, dont break pls



as u can see in the image
the reasoning should be shown streamed while the model is reasoning
the new chat started and the logo should dissapear when i start chatting
the text at the bottom says generating when the model is generating tokens
it should change from loading model when loading model
thinking when moel is htinking
generating when the model is generating output
also the moment i select a model from the model selector, you should load that model to vram to save time

i still cant see the reasoning tokens
just remove the enw chat logo altogether
￼the preloading of models works, but while doing so ensure to put the loading message at the bottom

 the new chat is still here, and i still cant see the reasoning tokens. ensure that the reasoning tokens will appear at the website. think hard and ensure

make all color in model_card blue, but when i hover over one, it is green. The currently selected one is filled with blue(it is correcly done now, dont change). make logos consistent with model - like brain for chat, open lock for uncensored, code for code and lightning for fast. also add a small logo on the tab of browser and change the tab name to ollama studio


in model card, for each use only the followin tags - chat, reasoning, uncensored, fast, super-smartcoding, experimental. update with this
also, add speed to all and set it to "- tok/s"

when i run the code when model is being preloaded, it switches to loading. im not sure if here the model is being loaded again. if it is, fix it. 
also, when i initially open the site, i want the last model that i used as the model present there. maybe store it somewhere
