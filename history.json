The character is portrayed by actor Keanu\u202fReeves.\n\n### Quick Overview\n| Feature | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Occupation** | Retired \u201chitman\u201d / assassin |\n| **Notable Traits** | Highly skilled with firearms, hand\u2011to\u2011hand combat, strategic, calm under pressure |\n| **Motivation** | Revenge for personal loss (e.g., the death of his wife, the killing of his dog) |\n| **Primary Conflicts** | The criminal underworld of assassins, organized crime syndicates, and secret contracts |\n\n### Filmography\n| Film | Release Year | Synopsis (brief) |\n|------|--------------|-------------------|\n| *John Wick* | 2014 | A retired hitman seeks vengeance for the murder of his beloved wife\u2019s gift\u2014a puppy\u2014after a gang of Russian mobsters kills his dog. |\n| *John Wick: Chapter\u202f2* | 2017 | Wick is forced back into the world of assassins when a former associate betrays him and a debt forces him to hunt a global contract. |\n| *John Wick: Chapter\u202f3 \u2013 Parabellum* | 2019 | With a $14\u202fmillion bounty on his head, Wick must evade the most feared killers in the world. |\n| *John Wick: Chapter\u202f4* | 2023 | Wick seeks to restore his reputation and break a binding contract with a powerful crime lord. |\n\n(Upcoming projects and expanded media are in development.)\n\n### Background\n- **Early Life**: Little is revealed in the films; the character is primarily defined by his professionalism and loyalty to a code among assassins.\n- **Family**: The death of his wife, Helen, and the death of her dog, Daisy, serve as the emotional catalyst for his actions.\n- **The Continental**: A neutral hotel and safe haven for assassins where Wick frequently stays; the chain is governed by a strict set of rules, famously encapsulated in the *\u201cno killing in the hotel\u201d* rule.\n\n### Cultural Impact\n- **Iconic Stunts**: The series is noted for its stylized gun\u2011fights, choreographed \u201cgun\u2011ninja\u201d combat, and the concept of \u201cthe Continental\u201d as a quasi\u2011legal sanctuary.\n- **Influence on Action Cinema**: It revitalized the \u201ctough\u2011but\u2011human\u201d assassin archetype and spurred similar action\u2011thriller franchises.\n- **Merchandise & Spin\u2011offs**: Includes video games (e.g., *John Wick \u2013 Chapter 2*), comic books, and a planned television series.\n\n### Key Traits\n- **Loyalty & Code**: Adheres to a strict code that includes respect for neutral ground and contractual obligations.\n- **Calm Demeanor**: Rarely displays emotion, preferring precise, efficient violence over theatrics.\n- **Adaptability**: Quickly adapts to new weapons, environments, and adversaries.\n\n### Fun Fact\nThe film series earned Keanu Reeves a reputation as one of the most physically fit actors in Hollywood, as the action sequences demanded intense training and stunt work.\n\n---\n\n**In short:** John Wick is a highly skilled, morally complex assassin who returns to the underworld to seek revenge for personal loss, leading to a series of high\u2011octane battles against other contract killers. The character is celebrated for its stylish action, nuanced moral code, and Keanu Reeves\u2019s portrayal."

        "content": "Sure! Below is a simple, classic implementation of **FizzBuzz** in Python.  \nIt prints the numbers 1\u2011100, but replaces multiples of 3 with `\"Fizz\"`, multiples of 5 with `\"Buzz\"`, and multiples of both 3 and 5 with `\"FizzBuzz\"`.\n\n```python\n# FizzBuzz \u2013 Classic Implementation\n\ndef fizzbuzz(n=100):\n    \"\"\"Prints numbers from 1 to n with Fizz/Buzz rules.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Build the output string\n        output = \"\"\n        if i % 3 == 0:\n            output += \"Fizz\"\n        if i % 5 == 0:\n            output += \"Buzz\"\n\n        # If output is empty, use the number itself\n        print(output or i)\n\n# Run it\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    fizzbuzz()\n```\n\n---\n\n### How it works\n\n| Condition | Result |\n|-----------|--------|\n| `i % 3 == 0` | Append `\"Fizz\"` |\n| `i % 5 == 0` | Append `\"Buzz\"` |\n| Both true | `\"FizzBuzz\"` |\n| None | Print the number `i` |\n\n---\n\n## Variations\n\n### 1. Return a list instead of printing\n\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz_list(n=100):\n    return [\n        (\"Fizz\" if i % 3 == 0 else \"\") + (\"Buzz\" if i % 5 == 0 else \"\") or i\n        for i in range(1, n + 1)\n    ]\n\n# Example\nprint(fizzbuzz_list(20))\n```\n\n### 2. Parameterize the divisors and words\n\n```python\ndef fizzbuzz_custom(n=100, a=3, b=5, word_a=\"Fizz\", word_b=\"Buzz\"):\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        out = \"\"\n        if i % a == 0: out += word_a\n        if i % b == 0: out += word_b\n        print(out or i)\n\n# Example: 7 \u2192 \"Foo\", 11 \u2192 \"Bar\"\nfizzbuzz_custom(20, 7, 11, \"Foo\", \"Bar\")\n```\n\n### 3. Using `itertools` for a more functional style\n\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef fizzbuzz_itertools(n=100):\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        print(\n            \"\".join(\n                word\n                for divisor, word in [(3, \"Fizz\"), (5, \"Buzz\")]\n                if i % divisor == 0\n            ) or i\n        )\n\nfizzbuzz_itertools()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Why FizzBuzz?\n\n- **Interview classic**: Demonstrates control flow, loops, and modular arithmetic.  \n- **Coding exercise**: Great for learning a new language or practicing basic scripting.  \n\nFeel free to tweak the code or add unit tests! Happy coding!"
